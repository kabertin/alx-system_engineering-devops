#Shell basics

Our project concern is to develop some scripts, so this document is for describing what each script is doing.

#Scripts

	- A script that displays the contents list of my current directory
	- A script that changes working directory to the user's home directory
	- A script that Displays a current directory contents in a long format
	- A script that Displays the current directory content including the hidden ones
	- A script that Displays a a long format, with user and group ID's numerically including hidden files. here we are displaying a directory content
	- A script that creates a directory named my_first_directory in the /tmp/ directory
